- **Instructor:** Rafael A. Irizarry.
- **Prerequisites:** None.
- **Software:** R.
- **Duration:** 1.5 hours.

## Description

This training session introduces core principles of effective data visualization, focusing on how to communicate information clearly and honestly. It highlights how visual choices–such as position, scale, color, and ordering–shape what audiences perceive and understand. Emphasis is placed on selecting appropriate plot types, avoiding misleading design choices, showing data in ways that support comparison, and considering human perception and accessibility. Together, these principles provide practical guidance for creating visualizations that are accurate, interpretable, and well-suited to their intended audience.
